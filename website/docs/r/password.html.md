# rundeck\_password

The password resource allows passwords to be stored in Rundeck's key store.
The key store is where Rundeck keeps credentials that are needed to access the nodes on which
it runs commands.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform.
Protect these artifacts accordingly.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "rundeck_password" "anvils" {
    path = "anvils/password"
    password = "${file("/secret.txt")}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The path within the key store where the password will be stored.

* `password` - (Required) The password to store

## Attributes Reference

Rundeck does not allow stored private keys to be retrieved via the API, so this resource does not
export any attributes.

## Import

Rundeck password can be faux imported. What this means is if there is a password located at the path, 
it will store a fake password in the state file. The next run will overwrite the existing password with the new
password. 

```
$ terraform import rundeck_password.default anvils/password
```
